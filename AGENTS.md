# DonorDesk

Agent guidance for coding on DonorDesk.

## Build / test commands
- Install: `pnpm install`
- DB migrate + seed: `pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:seed`
- Typecheck everything: `pnpm -r typecheck`
- Build everything: `pnpm -r build`
- Run API + Web together: `pnpm dev`
- Reporting golden-corpus eval: `pnpm --filter @donordesk/infrastructure reporting:eval`
- AI Reporter 2 worker tests (Python): `cd apps/workers && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests`
- AI Reporter 2 artifact-validator tests (TS): `node --test packages/infrastructure/test/artifact-validators.test.mjs`

## Architecture rules (Phase 1 + 2)
- Domain (`packages/domain`) is pure TypeScript — zero infrastructure deps.
- Application (`packages/application`) defines use case handlers + ports; no concrete
  adapters are imported here.
- Infrastructure (`packages/infrastructure`) implements ports (Prisma, storage,
  LLM, parsers, export builder, audit, notifications). One repository per aggregate.
- API (`apps/api`) wires routes to handlers. Routes are thin; Zod-validated.
- Web (`apps/web`) is Next.js App Router. Server actions for writes, RSC for reads.
- Workers (`apps/workers`) is FastAPI; the AI Reporter lives at
  `apps/workers/app/ai_reporter/` (12 SRP modules — `models`, `writer_contract`,
  `llm_gateway`, `outline`, `chart_suggester`, `draft_writer`, `critique_writer`,
  `refiner`, `artifact_validators`, `timeouts`, `pipeline`, `router`).

## AI Reporter 2 contracts (additive over v1)
- `GeneratedSection` carries optional `artifacts[]`, `qa[]`, `chartSpec?`,
  `deltaFromPrior?` fields (all backward-compatible with v1 generators).
- Artifact kinds: `TABLE | CHART | LIST | KEY_VALUE | QA | DELTA` (Zod schemas in
  `packages/contracts/src/reporting.ts`).
- Writer contract v2 is mirrored in
  `apps/workers/app/ai_reporter/writer_contract.py` (Python SSOT) and
  `packages/infrastructure/src/llm/ai-reporter/contract.ts` (TS mirror). Parity
  verified by `tests/test_ai_reporter.py`.
- Deterministic artifact validators live in
  `apps/workers/app/ai_reporter/artifact_validators.py` (Python, run on the
  worker before responding) and `packages/infrastructure/src/ai/artifact-validators.ts`
  (TS, run in the api on the response). Run `runAll(section, opts)` for the full set.
- Per-section timeout: `AI_REPORTER_DRAFT_TIMEOUT_MS=45000` (default), enforced by
  `apps/workers/app/ai_reporter/timeouts.py` + `AbortSignal.timeout` in the TS
  HTTP client. On timeout, the section falls back to deterministic output;
  the rest of the draft continues.
- Typed artifact persistence: `IReportArtifactRepository` (port) +
  `PrismaReportArtifactRepository` (impl), backing `ReportArtifact` and
  `ReportArtifactRow` tables with RLS forced and `donordesk_app` DML grants.
- Feature flag: `AI_REPORTER_ENABLED=1` in `/opt/donordesk/shared/api.env` (default
  off). When off, the api uses `LlmReportDraftGenerator` for all tenants.
- Worker URL: `AI_REPORTER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8092` (overrides the
  `HttpWorkerClient` default of `localhost:5000`).

## Architecture rules (Phase 1)
- Domain (`packages/domain`) is pure TypeScript — zero infrastructure deps.
- Application (`packages/application`) defines use case handlers + ports; no concrete
  adapters are imported here.
- Infrastructure (`packages/infrastructure`) implements ports (Prisma, storage,
  LLM, parsers, export builder, audit, notifications). One repository per aggregate.
- API (`apps/api`) wires routes to handlers. Routes are thin; Zod-validated.
- Web (`apps/web`) is Next.js App Router. Server actions for writes, RSC for reads.
- Workers (`apps/workers`) is FastAPI; it mirrors the same stub strategies so
  Kestra flows can call them.

## Conventions
- All aggregate roots carry `tenantId` (or `tenantIdValue` when persisted).
- Use the `Result<T, DomainError>` shape — no exceptions for expected failures.
- Domain events are emitted via `pullEvents()` on aggregates; the outbox pattern
  is wired in `PrismaAuditRepository.record()` (Phase 2 will promote to a real outbox).
- Every API mutation writes to `audit_events`.
- Every LLM response records `model` + `promptVersion` (ready for `llm_runs` table).

## Phase 1 deviations
Each swap point is an interface with a production target behind it. Current
state: PostgreSQL via Prisma, JWT auth, local file storage (dev default) with
Google Drive link-first primary / R2 optional via per-tenant
`Organization.storageProvider`, Kestra-or-BullMQ via `JOB_QUEUE` (memory
in-process default), stub LLM (dev default), pino logs, console email.
